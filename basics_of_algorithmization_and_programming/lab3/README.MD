The task was divided in 4 parts.

Translation: get a string from a user. print back only digits.



Compared to previous labs, the configuring part of the project takes longer. On my pc it took 500 seconds. Why? Because I took boost/algorithm library for string split function.

How to run the project? go to root of the repo, check FAQ.
