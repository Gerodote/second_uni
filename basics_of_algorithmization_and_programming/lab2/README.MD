write a function that calculates first formulae.
write a function that determines is a given point in shaded part.

also there was another task:

calculate first formulae for different x and print it all as a table.
calculate the series using different stops or for a range of values.

in addition:

translated: "calculate the formulae: sin(1) + sin(1.1) + ... + sin(2) ."

all of this can be tested in `build/lab2` . guide how to get the file in README.md in root folder of the repo.
